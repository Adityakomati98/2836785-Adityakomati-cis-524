What is this project about?

This project shows how the Heapsort algorithm works in two programming languages: C and Python. It also explains how these languages handle things like variables, memory, and how programs are written and run.

What’s in this project?

1. Code:

heapsort.c: The Heapsort program written in C.

heapsort.py: The same algorithm written in Python.



2. Document:

A comparison of C and Python in simple terms, focusing on:

How variables work.

How data is passed to functions.

How programs are run.

How memory is managed.

The style of programming each language uses.






---

What do I need to run this?

For C:

A program to compile and run C code, like GCC.


For Python:

Python 3 installed on your computer.



---

How do I run the code?

For C:

1. Open a terminal and compile the program:

gcc heapsort.c -o heapsort


2. Run the program:

./heapsort



For Python:

Run the program directly:

python heapsort.py

Key Takeaways:

1. Variables:

In C, variables only exist inside the function they are created in.

In Python, if a variable is not found in the current function, Python can look outside to check if it exists.


2. Running the Code:

C needs to be compiled (translated into a language the computer understands). This makes it faster but requires extra steps.

Python runs the code directly, which is slower but easier for testing.


3. Managing Memory:

In C, you have to manually free up memory after using it. Forgetting this can cause issues.

Python automatically cleans up unused memory.


4. Style of Programming:

C follows a step-by-step style (procedural programming).

Python can be written in different styles, including object-oriented programming (using classes).

How does Heapsort work?

Heapify: Rearranges a list so the largest number is always at the top (like a leaderboard).

Sorting: Keeps moving the largest number to the end of the list until everything is sorted.

Why is this project useful?

It’s a great way to:

Learn how programming languages handle the same task differently.

Understand basic concepts like how variables and memory work.

See the advantages and disadvantages of a low-level language (C) vs. a high-level language (Python).
